# Tech-Talks-Codes
This repository contains the codes for the Tech Talks Videos of the channel Chennai Robotics Platform.
The codes for IOT will work only if your PC and Raspi are on the same network and make sure you replace the IP adress of the raspi with your local IP address.

I am aware that there are many question which are left unanswered like how to we setup a raspberry pi and how to use sockets and stuff. But this series is only to explain about the existing technologies and not to teach them from scratch. But I do plan to teach al the stuff in this video from scratch in my future video so subscribe to Chennai Robotics Platform and Stay tuned.
